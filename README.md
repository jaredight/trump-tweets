Stata code to analyze President Trump's tweets for my econometrics final, spring 2019

Abstract:
In this paper I examine what words and factors in a tweet promote “likes” and retweets on Twitter.
I use data pulled from Twitter’s API on President Trump. I determine what factors lead to more likes and retweets. 
For example, I determine the impact of including a link on likes and shares.
